# Major Project Reflection - Eva Malezhyk
## What advice would I give myself?
- Definitely  work on one thing at a time
- Do the proper research first before just trying things out 

## Needs to Have list complete?
For our needs to have list we finished most of the things we needed to, we just had small little details that we couldn't get to work.
From our nice to have list we were able to get a few of them done.

##The hardest part?
-Not knowing what to do next
-If something continuosly didn't work and you just can't figure out how to fix the problem 
-There was lots of bug fixing we had to do

##Were there any problems you could not solve?
There was quite some of the functions that we coundl't figure out espacially from the nice to have list, I think we just need a lot more time to add more things or just make the game look more professional.
