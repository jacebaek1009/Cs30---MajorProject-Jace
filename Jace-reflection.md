-  What Advice would I give to myself
  -well one advice I would give to myself would be to take things one step at a time. creating multiple things at once makes bug fixes so much harder wasting alot of time
   I spent way to much time making things more complicated then they shouldve been.

  - Was Everything in my needs to have completed.
    -Well most of it expect partly order. as i ran out of time I was unable to finish my orders at the end. I have everything to display the orders but it did not work out as I ran out of time

  - What was the hardest part.
    -I think getting going was the hardest part. Like putting my mind to a certain task and finishing it, it took away a lot of time and the game would have been way more completed with the time. The game was also a very big project so it was hard to keep track of time as there was too many things to do
    -  Was there any problem that I could not solve.
        -Yes and no i was in the end able to figure out how to mae order work but due to time i was unable to implement it
