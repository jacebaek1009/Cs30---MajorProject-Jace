# Project Description
My main goal of this major project is to create a game taken by insiration by papas's pizzeria. I will write my code in mostly Java script(a liitle bit of html, css) with the knowledge I have learnt in class and further research with other sources such as youtube videos, tutorials, etc. This game will have elements we have learnt in class such as arrays, object notation, OOP, etc. This game has the player take an order from a customer and use several stations to prepare the food then serve  it to the customer while receiving a accuracy percantage. We will have to contribute time outside of class as this game is a hefty goal for the both of us which will require realistic planning as we are not able to fully replicate the original game with the given amount of time. So it is nessessary to leave out some elements of the game to finish the game in the given time.

## Needs to have List:

- NPC's that give orders to the player
- An object that displays the order for the player to see
- A few stations to prepare the food, such as cooking, plating, drink, order.
- A variable that tells the player how well they performed each dish on each station.(this could be done by subtracting points based on mistakes and the amount of time it takes to finish the food)
- The player should be able to give the completed order to the customer 
- Basic Sprites to indicate the players, food, NPC, room...
- to be able to place ingredients on the main piece and calculate how accurate it was
- a Variable to indicate how much money the player has accumulated
- A variable on the accuracy percentage
- sound effects
- Start screen

## Nice to have List:

- Basic animation(NPC Walking or Talking)
- Good looking sprites(maybe personal drawn ones?)
- Character customization
- Room customization
- Days/Levels
- Ways the player can spend money(Maybe on new ingridients or cosmetics?)
- Minigames
- Volume adjuster
- FPS counter
- StoryLine
- Variety of NPC's
- Level up system
- Animation for placing ingridients(such as chopping)
- Sauce Physics!(Or ingredient placing in general)
- special customers
